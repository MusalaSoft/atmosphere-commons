# atmosphere-commons
The common libraries of the ATMOSPHERE mobile testing framework.

## Build the project
You can build the project using the included Gradle wrapper by running:
* `./gradlew build` on Linux/macOS
* `gradlew build` on Windows

## Making changes
If you make changes to this project and would like to use your new version in another ATMOSPHERE framework project that depends on this one, after a successful build also run:
* `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` (Linux/macOS)
* `gradlew publishToMavenLocal` (Windows)

to publish the jar to your local Maven repository. The ATMOSPHERE framework projects are configured to use the artifact published in the local Maven repository first.
